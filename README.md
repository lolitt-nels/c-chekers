**Checkers Game README**

Welcome to our simple Checkers game implemented in C! This program allows you to play a classic game of Checkers against another human player on the same computer.

### How to Play:
1. **Compile the Code:**
    - Compile the source code (`checkers.c`) using your preferred C compiler. For example:
        ```
        gcc -o checkers checkers.c
        ```
2. **Run the Game:**
    - Execute the compiled binary:
        ```
        ./checkers
        ```
3. **Gameplay:**
    - The game starts with a standard 8x8 checkers board.
    - Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward.
    - To move, input the coordinates of the piece you want to move and the coordinates of the destination square when prompted.
    - If you have the opportunity to capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it diagonally, you must take that opportunity.
    - The game continues until one player has captured all of the opponent's pieces or one player cannot make any more moves.
4. **Winning:**
    - The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or when one player cannot make any more moves.
    - The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces or has the most pieces remaining wins the game.
5. **Exiting:**
    - To exit the game at any time, press `Ctrl + C` or follow the on-screen instructions.
